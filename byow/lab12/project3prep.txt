Q: Can you think of an analogy between the process of tesselating hexagons and randomly generating a world using rooms and hallways? 
What is the hexagon and what is the tesselation on the Project 3 side?

A:The hexagon would be the room and tesselating them together forms hallways and entrances.

Q: If you were to start working on world generation, what kind of method would you think of writing first? 
Think back to the lab and the process used to eventually get to tesselating hexagons.

A:I would first thin about the method that randomly generates a room, and then worry about the method to stick these together.

-----
Q: What distinguishes a hallway from a room? How are they similar?

A: A room can be thought of as a box itself whereas the hallway is simply what arises from the connection of two rooms. I.e tesselating two rooms together will result in a hallway

Q: For tesselating hexagons, one of the hardest parts is figuring out where to place each hexagon/how to easily place hexagons on screen in an algorithmic way. 
After looking at your own implemention, consider the implementation provided near the end of the lab. 
How did your implementation differ from the given one? What lessons can be learned from it?

A: I did not have the AHA moment of breaking down the world into columns. I was trying by brute force to fit the hexagons and i would just stop when something worked.

-----
Q: Consider an algorithm for placing rooms and hallways on your map. 
Ideally, consider many algorithms and think about what makes some easier or harder to implement. Try and bring those ideas together into a single simple algorithm which accomplishes the task. 
In general, algorithms with as few edge cases as possible are better algorithms.

A: One could do the following: first take the rooms in ordered list from largest to smallest, place the largest room and then in the remaining space recursively add the smallest. If  a room cant be added back track and move the previous room and then try again.
